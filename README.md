## Lessons Learned
 - Being able to see a visual representation of our code in the browser was really helpful in beginning to understand the connection between HTML, CSS and JavaScript, as well as how the DOM works when it comes to targeting and manipulating elements. This also lent itself to helping us figure out where something was not working as we expected in the codebase based on what was displaying or not displaying.
